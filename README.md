My submission for an AI competition. It simply makes moves that I have analyzed as better positions take.  The driver code is very simplistic and not very optimized because it was taken from an ACM problem I solved in about 2 hours.


The program takes input of the AI's color, w or b, and then while the game is being played takes a move from standard in and outputs a valid move if one is avalible and -1 if there is no valid move to be made. The moves are numbered 0 through 63 with the top left corner being 0 and the top right corner being 7.
